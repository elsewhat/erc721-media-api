# ERC721 Media API

The ERC721 Media API provides a standardized approach for allowing third party access to media files for ERC721 NFTs if the owner gives permission. 

Example of media files are:  
1. Rigged 3D models in VRM, FBX and GLB formats to be used in open worlds such as Cryptovoxels, Sandbox, Decentraland or Somnium  
1. 2D sprite sheets to use in 2D based worlds such as worldwideweb3
